    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="3MA 1:1" />Now Philopater, on learning from those who came back that Antiochus had made himself master of the places which belonged to himself, sent orders to all his infantry and cavalry, took with him his sister Arsinoe, and marched out as far as the parts of Raphia, where Antiochus and his forces encamped. <verse eid="3MA 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="3MA 1:2" />And one Theodotus, intending to carry out his design, took with him the bravest of the armed men who had been before committed to his trust by Ptolemy, and got through at night to the tent of Ptolemy, to kill him on his own responsibility, and so to end the war. <verse eid="3MA 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="3MA 1:3" />But Dositheus, called the son of Drimulus, by birth a Jew, afterward a renegade from the laws and observances of his country, conveyed Ptolemy away, and made an obscure person lie down in his stead in the tent. It turned out that this man received the fate which was meant for the other. <verse eid="3MA 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="3MA 1:4" />A fierce battle then took place. The men of Antiochus were prevailing. Arsinoe continually went up and down the ranks, and with dishevelled hair, with tears and entreaties, begged the soldiers to fight bravely for themselves, their children, and wives, and promised that if they proved conquerors, she would give them each two minas of gold. <verse eid="3MA 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="3MA 1:5" />It thus fell out that their enemies were defeated in hand-to-hand encounter, and that many of them were taken prisoners. <verse eid="3MA 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="3MA 1:6" />Having vanquished this attempt, the king then decided to proceed to the neighboring cities, and encourage them. <verse eid="3MA 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="3MA 1:7" />By doing this, and by making donations to their temples, he inspired his subjects with confidence.<verse eid="3MA 1:7" /></para>

He said, “Even if they were deprived of this honor, I shouldn’t be.” <verse eid="3MA 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="3MA 1:13" />He asked why, when he entered all the other temples, did none of the priests who were present forbid him. <verse eid="3MA 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="3MA 1:14" />He was thoroughly answered by someone, that he did wrong to boast of this. <verse eid="3MA 1:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="3MA 1:15" />“Well, since I have done this,” said he, “be the cause what it may, shall I not enter with or without your consent?”<verse eid="3MA 1:15" /></para>

When we were eager to enter their temple, and to honor it with the most beautiful and exquisite gifts, <verse eid="3MA 3:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="3MA 3:18" />they were so carried away by their old arrogance as to forbid us the entrance, while we, out of our forbearance toward all men, refrained from exercising our power upon them. <verse eid="3MA 3:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="3MA 3:19" />Thus, exhibiting their enmity against us, they alone among the nations lift up their heads against kings and benefactors, as men unwilling to submit to any reasonable thing. <verse eid="3MA 3:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="3MA 3:20" />We then, having endeavored to make allowance for the madness of these people, and on our victorious return treating all people in Egypt courteously, acted in a manner which was befitting. <verse eid="3MA 3:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="3MA 3:21" />Accordingly, bearing no ill will against their kinsmen, but rather remembering our connection with them, and the numerous matters with sincere heart from a remote period entrusted to them, we wished to venture a total alteration of their state, by giving them the rights of citizens of Alexandria, and to admit them to the everlasting rites of our solemnities. <verse eid="3MA 3:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="3MA 3:22" />All this, however, they have taken in a very different spirit. With their innate malignity, they have spurned the fair offer, and constantly inclining to evil, <verse eid="3MA 3:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="3MA 3:23" />have rejected the inestimable rights.

Full power was given them, without warrant or special commission, to destroy those who had transgressed the law of God boldly in every part of the king’s dominions. <verse eid="3MA 7:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="3MA 7:13" />Their priests, then, as it was appropriate, saluted him with good wishes, and all the people echoed with the “Hallelujah!” Then they joyfully departed. <verse eid="3MA 7:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="3MA 7:14" />Then they punished and shamefully destroyed every polluted Jew that fell in their way, <verse eid="3MA 7:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="3MA 7:15" />slaying this way, in that day, more than three hundred men, and esteeming this destruction of the wicked a season of joy. <verse eid="3MA 7:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="3MA 7:16" />They themselves having held closely to their God to death, and having enjoyed a full deliverance, departed from the city garlanded with sweet-flowered wreaths of every kind. Uttering exclamations of joy, with songs of praise, and melodious hymns, they thanked the God of their fathers, the eternal Savior of Israel. <verse eid="3MA 7:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="3MA 7:17" />Having arrived at Ptolemais, called from the specialty of that district “Rose-bearing”, where the fleet, in accordance with the general wish, waited for them seven days, <verse eid="3MA 7:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="3MA 7:18" />they partook of a banquet of deliverance, for the king generously granted them all the means of securing a return home. <verse eid="3MA 7:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="3MA 7:19" />They were accordingly brought back in peace, while they gave utterance to appropriate thanks; and they determined to observe these days during their sojourn as days of joyfulness. <verse eid="3MA 7:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="3MA 7:20" />These they registered as sacred upon a pillar, when they had dedicated the place of their festivity to be one of prayer. They departed unharmed, free, abundant in joy, preserved by the king’s command, by land, by sea, and by river, each to his own home. <verse eid="3MA 7:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="3MA 7:21" />They had more weight than before among their enemies, and were honored and feared. No one in any way robbed them of their goods. <verse eid="3MA 7:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="3MA 7:22" />Every man received back his own, according to inventory, those who had obtained their goods, giving them up with the greatest terror. For the greatest God made perfect wonders for their salvation. <verse eid="3MA 7:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="3MA 7:23" />Blessed be the Redeemer of Israel forever! Amen.<verse eid="3MA 7:23" /></para>
