  <para style="ip">Titus wasn't a Jew and didn't originally believe in God. However, in later times he became a believer and from there, he became a helper in Paul's work. This letter was sent by Paul there to Titus in Crete where he had been left to look after a group of believers. (Crete is an island that was a part of Greece.)</para>
  <para style="is2">This letter</para>
  <para style="ip">There are three main things contained in this letter: Firstly Titus is reminded about what is appropriate behaviour for teachers of believers. It was important that he understand this because those from Crete had many undesirable customs and there were many teachers of false doctrines that would confuse believers.</para>
  <para style="ip">Secondly Titus was advised Titus how to teach the various groups of believers there, including young men and slaves, along with older men and women. (Then those older women were to teach the younger women.)</para>
  <para style="ip">Finally Paul advised Titus about how believers should live, including avoiding attacking others, arguing, and splitting the believers into opposing groups. Paul reminded Titus again to follow the teachings of Jesus the messiah and obey what he commanded us.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul wanted it to be known that it's very important for believers to behave well (1:6; 2:7,14; 3:1,8-9,14) even though doing good things can't earn their salvation (3:5).</para>
