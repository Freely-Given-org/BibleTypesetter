# OSIS Test Versions folder

In this folder we provide [OSIS XML](https://crosswire.org/osis/) text versions.

OSIS is no longer being advanced as a standard,
but some Bible translations were first created as OSIS files
(rather than the more common [USFM](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/)).

## Copyright issues

Of course, we can't distribute copyrighted Bibles here.
However, the [OpenScriptures Hebrew Bible](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb) (WLC)
is provided in OSIS format, so we copy that into here.

Also the [CrossWire Bible Society](https://crosswire.org/)
provide [their KJB](https://wiki.crosswire.org/User:Dmsmith) in OSIS.
We copy v2.6 here.

Also [eBible.org](https://ebible.org/) used to provide
OSIS Bibles up until early 2020,
so we have included some of these older copies here.
