Please double-check the text in advance before using in public. Some things (like capitalisation of ‘him’ referring to Jesus or ‘father’ referring to God) in the <char style="em">RV</char> haven't been decided yet so we're still testing both ways.</para><para style="is1">Goals and intended audience</para><para style="m">The OET has the following goals:</para><para style="b" /><para style="li">The primary goal of the <char style="em">Open English Translation</char> is <char style="bd">to make the Bible more accessible to this current generation</char> with the best of a free-and-open easy-to-understand <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> alongside a faithful <char style="em">Literal Version</char> so that readers themselves can checkout what was said and what is interpreted.</para><para style="li">Part of the motivation comes from our work on the street and door-to-door where we worked hard to explain the Good News about Jesus to people without any church background. The <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> strives to replace jargon and terminology that's only heard at church with words and phrases that should be understood by modern English speakers.</para><para style="li">A further goal is to expose more people to some of the background of where our Bibles come from and how translators make decisions, i.e., <char style="bd">to teach</char> a little more about original manuscripts and to challenge a little more about English translation traditions (some going back to the 1500's) that can possibly be improved.</para><para style="li">Finally, we also want a translation that can be read by Christians with many years of Bible reading experience, but who might benefit by reading the accounts in slightly different words that make it fresh and interesting, and hopefully it will provoke deeper thought into what the original speakers or writers likely meant.</para><para style="is1">Distinctives</para><para style="m">The OET has the following distinguishing points:</para><para style="b" /><para style="li">An easy-to-understand <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> alongside a very <char style="em">Literal Version</char></para><para style="li">A generous open license so that the <char style="em">Open English Translation</char> can be freely used in any Bible app or website, or printed in your church Bible-study notes without even needing to request permission.</para><para style="li">The <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> speaks like people around you. Because the history and legacy of English Bibles now goes back for hundreds of years, many things have been carried over that readers don't even realise. For example, we all smile at Yoda saying, “Strong is the force.” That's because naturally we would say, “The force is strong.” So think about “Great is your faithfulness.” (At least Miles Coverdale improved it in 1535 if you look carefully.) But our aim isn't at all to criticise those who came before (because we very-much build on their shoulders)—we just want our readers to be able to share the Good News of Jesus the Messiah with others, without them thinking that Christians speak like dinosaurs (or Yoda)!</para><para style="li">The <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> has section headings and cross-references and most of the other features that help modern Bible readers.</para><para style="li">The <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> uses modern units for all measurements (easy to understand and visualise), whereas the <char style="em">Literal Version</char> retains the ancient units (useful for historical and symbolic studies).</para><para style="li">The <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> uses well-known figures of speech, or if the original figure of speech is not readily understandable, explains the point that the author appears to be trying to express. On the other hand, the <char style="em">Literal Version</char> retains the original figurative language (even if it's not a figure of speech that we are familiar with).</para><para style="li"><char style="it">Up</char> and <char style="it">down</char> in the original languages (and thus in the <char style="em">Literal Version</char>) refer to <char style="it">uphill</char> and <char style="it">downhill</char>. However, in the <char style="em">Readers' Version</char>, <char style="it">up</char> and <char style="it">down</char> are used to refer to <char style="it">north</char> and <char style="it">south</char> respectively as per our modern norm.</para><para style="li">The <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> is less formal than most modern English Bible translations, for example, we would use contracted words like <char style="it">we'll</char> and <char style="it">didn't</char>, especially when it's in direct speech. (Always remember that the Bible was written in the languages of the common people.)</para><para style="li">The <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> uses section headings which are very helpful to skim through when trying to locate a certain passage. However, you'll quickly notice that they are formatted in such a way as not to break the flow of the letter or narrative. This is to visually help the reader to appreciate the full context of the part they're reading, and not to ignore the connections with what came before and what follows.</para><para style="m">We've also tried to focus our section headings on principles that are being taught, rather than just focusing on the events happening at the time.</para><para style="m">We'll also be providing a list of these section headings that you can quickly skim through (and we hope to include extra, alternative headings).</para><para style="li">Being a 21<char style="sup">st</char> century translation done in an era when there is much more effort in general to respect speakers of other languages (including the languages of ethnic minorities in our own countries) and to pronounce their names and placenames correctly, the <char style="em">OET</char> attempts to do the same for Biblical names and placenames. (All this is a little complex when we have both Hebrew and Greek versions of names and placenames—more below.) Certainly by showing a little more respect for Hebrew names, we hope to make this Bible translation a little more “Jew-friendly”. If you have difficulty following the names in the <char style="em">Literal Version</char>, you can always look across to the <char style="em">Literal Version</char>. (Most English readers looking at names in the Bible all the way from <char style="it">Jericho</char> to <char style="it">Jesus</char> would have no idea that there's no <char style="bd">J</char> letter or sound in either Hebrew or Greek, plus there's absolutely no such name as <char style="it">James</char> in the New Testament manuscripts—it's a historical accident carried through from an inconsistency by John Wycliffe—see https:<optbreak />www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/james-or-jacob-in-the-bible/ for example.)</para><para style="li">In addition to wanting to get names and placenames more accurate, we've also attempted to modernise and simplify the spelling (transliterations) of these names to make it easier for readers to pronounce them as they come across them, e.g., using <char style="bd">f</char> instead of <char style="bd">ph</char>, so <char style="it">Epafras</char> instead of <char style="it">Epaphras</char>. (Oddly, even traditional English Bible translations surprisingly do use <char style="it">Felix</char> and <char style="it">Festus</char>.)</para><para style="li">With regular words, we've tried to do the opposite, i.e., to use less Greek rather than more wherever possible. So a word like <char style="it">baptise</char> (which is an adapted transliteration of the Greek verb), actually gets translated, so this example becomes <char style="it">immerse</char>.</para><para style="li"><char style="it">Italics</char> are only used for <char style="em">emphasis</char>, not to indicate <char style="it">added words</char> as historically done in older translations due to limitations of the original printing processes. The <char style="em">OET</char> fixes the problem where most modern printing uses <char style="it">italics</char> for <char style="em">emphasis</char> whereas older Bibles use <char style="it">italics</char> for the words which should actually be <char style="bd">deemphasised</char>, i.e., the words which actually <char style="bd">aren't</char> in the original manuscripts!</para><para style="li">The English <char style="it">Christ</char> is an adapted transliteration of the Koine Greek word <char style="it">Kristos</char> used for the original Hebrew <char style="it">Messiah</char>. (It's not Jesus' surname!) It seems to make sense to only use one word consistently rather than using two words for the same thing (just because they came from two different languages), so the <char style="em">OET</char> has elected to only use <char style="it">Messiah</char>. However, these words actually have a meaning, just as <char style="it">President</char> is not just a title, but someone who <char style="it">presides</char> over governmental meetings. So going a step further, we have chosen to use the contemporary <char style="bd">meaning</char> of the word in the <char style="em">Literal Version</char>. The original meaning is <char style="it">one who is anointed</char> (by pouring a hornful of oil over them), but we use the extended meaning which is <char style="it">one who is selected/chosen (by God)</char>.</para><para style="li">Most readers living in modern democracies have never been familiar with the concept of an ancient king or <char style="it">lord</char> who has the power of life and death over them. Thus the title <char style="it">Lord Jesus</char> is easily said, yet relatively few actually live with Jesus as the lord of their thoughts and actions and daily activities. (Just think how many would embarrassingly rush to turn off the video they're streaming if Jesus appeared in the room.) As a reaction to the word <char style="it">Lord</char> seemingly becoming so cliché for many Christians, we use the translation <char style="it">master</char> as a way to get readers to at least think a little more about what the concept might mean. (The word <char style="it">boss</char> felt a little informal.)</para><para style="li">The <char style="em">Literal Version</char> tries to add as little as possible that's not actually there in the original manuscripts. Of course, we add spaces between words so we can read it faster, and we add capitals at the start of sentences as per standard, modern English, but we don't capitalise words like <char style="it">Kingdom of Heaven</char> or even <char style="it">He</char> when it refers to Jesus, because the concept of capital and small letters didn't even exist when original manuscripts like the portion visible at https:<optbreak />greekcntr.org/manuscripts/data/1G20001.htm were written. (Our policy has more to do with accuracy and education than it does with “lack of respect” or any such thing. Often this goes against religious tradition of the last few centuries, but just because something is traditional, does not necessarily mean that it is correct or even helpful.)</para><para style="li">Most dialects of modern English don't distinguish between <char style="it">you (singular)</char> referring to just one person, and <char style="it">you (plural)</char> referring to a group of people. However, the original languages clearly distinguish these, so in order to indicate this to our readers the <char style="em">Literal Version</char> uses <char style="it" closed="false">you</char><char style="em">_</char>all<unmatched marker="it*" /> for the plural form (although we are aware that some modern dialects now prefer <char style="it">yous</char>).</para><para style="li">Because the <char style="em">Literal Version</char> so closely follows the original languages, it's important to remember that words often don't match one-to-one between languages. This is one reason why the <char style="em">OET-LV</char> reads strangely: because we try to avoid using different English words if we can; knowing that the <char style="em">OET-LV</char> will not be natural English. Again, this is because we want the <char style="em">OET-LV</char> to be a window into what's actually written in the original languages. For fluent English (like in the <char style="em">Readers' Version</char>) the same Greek word might require several different translations when used in different contexts. For example, the Greek word translated <char style="it">raise</char> in the <char style="em">OET-LV</char> would likely require the following changes:</para><para style="li">to <char style="it">raise</char> from sitting, we'd want: <char style="it">stand up</char></para><para style="li">to <char style="it">raise</char> from bed, we'd want: <char style="it">get up</char></para><para style="li">to <char style="it">raise</char> from the grave, we'd want: <char style="it">come back to life</char></para><para style="li">to <char style="it">raise</char> an object, we'd want: <char style="it">lift up</char></para><para style="li">to <char style="it">raise</char> a person, we'd often want: <char style="it">exalt</char> or <char style="it">praise</char></para><para style="m">Alert readers might be aware that there's a play on words here in the gospels. When Jesus talked about himself <char style="it">being raised up</char>, it was deliberately ambiguous because his hearers didn't understand until right near the end that he was going to be executed. So we, looking back in history, know that he was talking about coming back to life, but at the time, they were just very confused and didn't understand what he meant. But amazingly, as well as referring to his resurrection, <char style="it">raising</char> also refers to his crucifixion as the victims on the stakes were also <char style="it">raised</char>. (See John 3:14.) Sadly, it's not usually possible to make a translation easy to read and understand in our current times, without losing some of the underlying meaning or ambiguities or word-plays that were presented to the original hearers. That's exactly why it's good to have <char style="em">two</char> different translations side-by-side!</para><para style="li">These particular pages use British spelling, but American spelling will also be available in the future.</para><para style="li">Our preference in most editions is to place <char style="em">The Gospel according to John</char> <char style="bd">before</char> <char style="em">Matthew</char>. This has a couple of advantages:</para><para style="li">The Old Testament starts with “In the beginning, Elohim created…” and the New Testament starts with “In the beginning was the Messenger…”.</para><para style="li"><char style="em">Acts</char> ends up right after the first book by its author <char style="em">Luke</char>.</para><para style="li">It just reminds readers that the order of the “books” in the Bible is not set by sacred degree--only by tradition.</para><para style="m">Some do complain that the traditional order of the first four gospel accounts represent the lion, the calf, the man, and the eagle of Rev 4:6-7 which allegedly match with the banners (not described in the Bible) of the four divisions of the tribes of Israel mentioned in Numbers 2.</para><para style="li">Beware of some traps interpreting the <char style="em">Literal Version</char>. Because it's not designed to be used alone (but rather alongside the <char style="em">Readers' Version</char>) it's <char style="bd">much more literal</char> than most other “literal versions”. You'll quickly notice lighter colours that mark the deemphasis of words that had to be added to make the English sentences even make sense. But there's at least two other things that aren't necessarily changed in the English <char style="em">Literal Version</char>:</para><para style="li">Other languages use the negative differently, especially when it's doubled or tripled in the sentence. If you don't understand this, you could easily think that the original means the opposite of what the words actually appear to say. For example the double negative: “You are<char style="em">_</char> not <char style="em">_</char>caring<char style="em">_</char>about no one.” (adapted from Matthew 22:16). In natural, fluent English, we would have to reverse the second negative to get the expected meaning, ending up with <char style="it">anyone</char> as you'll find in the <char style="em">Readers' Version</char>. But in Greek, the second negative adds emphasis rather than reversing the first negative. So our <char style="em">Literal Version</char> shows you the words that are actually there (in the Greek in this case).</para><para style="li">Other languages may omit (or <char style="it">elide</char>) words which are clearly implied to the original reader, but which the modern English reader finds strange, e.g., a son may be divided against his father, and a daughter her mother. The elided words are “may be divided against”.</para><para style="m">Always check the <char style="em">Readers' Version</char> carefully for how it is translated into modern, idiomatic English before jumping to any conclusions of your own about what the original language or the <char style="em">Literal Version</char> says or doesn't say.</para></periph>
