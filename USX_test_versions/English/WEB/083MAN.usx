Of your infinite mercies, you have appointed repentance to sinners, that they may be saved. You therefore, O Lord, who are the God of the just, have not appointed repentance to the just, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against you, but you have appointed repentance to me who am a sinner. <verse eid="MAN 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="MAN 1:9" />For I have sinned more than the number of the sands of the sea.
