It causes all men who drink it to go astray. <verse eid="1ES 3:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="1ES 3:19" />It makes the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be the same, likewise of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich. <verse eid="1ES 3:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="1ES 3:20" />It also turns every thought into cheer and mirth, so that a man remembers neither sorrow nor debt. <verse eid="1ES 3:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="1ES 3:21" />It makes every heart rich, so that a man remembers neither king nor local governor.

He is their lord and has dominion over them. In whatever he commands them, they obey him. <verse eid="1ES 4:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="1ES 4:4" />If he tells them to make war the one against the other, they do it. If he sends them out against the enemies, they go, and conquer mountains, walls, and towers. <verse eid="1ES 4:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1ES 4:5" />They kill and are killed, and don’t disobey the king’s commandment. If they win the victory, they bring everything to the king—all the plunder and everything else. <verse eid="1ES 4:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="1ES 4:6" />Likewise for those who are not soldiers, and don’t have anything to do with wars, but farm, when they have reaped again that which they had sown, they bring some to the king and compel one another to pay tribute to the king. <verse eid="1ES 4:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1ES 4:7" />He is just one man! If he commands people to kill, they kill. If he commands them to spare, they spare. <verse eid="1ES 4:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="1ES 4:8" />If he commands them to strike, they strike. If he commands them to make desolate, they make desolate.

    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="1ES 4:13" />Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak: <verse eid="1ES 4:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="1ES 4:14" />“O sirs, isn’t the king great, and men are many, and isn’t wine strong? Who is it then who rules them, or has the lordship over them? Aren’t they women? <verse eid="1ES 4:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="1ES 4:15" />Women have given birth to the king and all the people who rule over sea and land. <verse eid="1ES 4:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="1ES 4:16" />They came from women. Women nourished up those who planted the vineyards, from where the wine comes. <verse eid="1ES 4:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="1ES 4:17" />Women also make garments for men. These bring glory to men. Without women, men can’t exist. <verse eid="1ES 4:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="1ES 4:18" />Yes, and if men have gathered together gold and silver and any other beautiful thing, and see a woman who is lovely in appearance and beauty, <verse eid="1ES 4:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="1ES 4:19" />they let all those things go and gape at her, and with open mouth stare at her. They all have more desire for her than for gold, or silver, or any other beautiful thing. <verse eid="1ES 4:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="1ES 4:20" />A man leaves his own father who brought him up, leaves his own country, and joins with his wife. <verse eid="1ES 4:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="1ES 4:21" />With his wife he ends his days, with no thought for his father, mother, or country. <verse eid="1ES 4:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="1ES 4:22" />By this also you must know that women have dominion over you. Don’t you labor and toil, and bring it all to give to women? <verse eid="1ES 4:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="1ES 4:23" />Yes, a man takes his sword and goes out to travel, to rob, to steal, and to sail on the sea and on rivers. <verse eid="1ES 4:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="1ES 4:24" />He sees a lion and walks in the darkness. When he has stolen, plundered, and robbed, he brings it to the woman he loves. <verse eid="1ES 4:24" /><verse number="25" style="v" sid="1ES 4:25" />Therefore a man loves his wife better than father or mother. <verse eid="1ES 4:25" /><verse number="26" style="v" sid="1ES 4:26" />Yes, there are many who have lost their minds for women, and become slaves for their sakes. <verse eid="1ES 4:26" /><verse number="27" style="v" sid="1ES 4:27" />Many also have perished, have stumbled, and sinned, for women. <verse eid="1ES 4:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="1ES 4:28" />Now don’t you believe me? Isn’t the king great in his power? Don’t all regions fear to touch him? <verse eid="1ES 4:28" /><verse number="29" style="v" sid="1ES 4:29" />Yet I saw him and Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the illustrious Barticus, sitting at the right hand of the king, <verse eid="1ES 4:29" /><verse number="30" style="v" sid="1ES 4:30" />and taking the crown from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head. Yes, she struck the king with her left hand. <verse eid="1ES 4:30" /><verse number="31" style="v" sid="1ES 4:31" />At this, the king gaped and gazed at her with open mouth. If she smiles at him, he laughs. But if she takes any displeasure at him, he flatters her, that she might be reconciled to him again. <verse eid="1ES 4:31" /><verse number="32" style="v" sid="1ES 4:32" />O sirs, how can it not be that women are strong, seeing they do this?”<verse eid="1ES 4:32" /></para>

Therefore the truth is great, and stronger than all things. <verse eid="1ES 4:35" /><verse number="36" style="v" sid="1ES 4:36" />All the earth calls upon truth, and the sky blesses truth. All works shake and tremble, but with truth there is no unrighteous thing. <verse eid="1ES 4:36" /><verse number="37" style="v" sid="1ES 4:37" />Wine is unrighteous. The king is unrighteous. Women are unrighteous. All the children of men are unrighteous, and all their works are unrighteous. There is no truth in them. They shall also perish in their unrighteousness. <verse eid="1ES 4:37" /><verse number="38" style="v" sid="1ES 4:38" />But truth remains, and is strong forever. Truth lives and conquers forevermore. <verse eid="1ES 4:38" /><verse number="39" style="v" sid="1ES 4:39" />With truth there is no partiality toward persons or rewards, but truth does the things that are just, instead of any unrighteous or wicked things. All men approve truth’s works. <verse eid="1ES 4:39" /><verse number="40" style="v" sid="1ES 4:40" />In truth’s judgment is not any unrighteousness.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="41" style="v" sid="1ES 4:41" />With that, he stopped speaking. Then all the people shouted and said, “Great is truth, and strong above all things!”<verse eid="1ES 4:41" /></para>
