# Open English Translation Literal Version (OET-LV)

Sample USX files for SILE typesetting development.

Note that the OET-LV is typeset differently from most traditional Bibles.

1. There’s no paragraphs or indenting or section headings (as it attempts to be more like the original texts except just with added spaces and punctuation and capitalisatio)
2. Every sentence can start on a new line if that looks better
3. Chapter numbers are downplayed so a bit smaller than other Bibles make them (definitely no drop caps styles please)
4. Added words (in &lt;char style="add"&gt;...&lt;/char&gt;) are grey (not italics like many Bibles)
Note: Added words and footnotes might still contain some special characters or prefixes
that distinguish particular classes of words or notes --
these will eventually be transformed into different styles.

(It’s not styled very well yet, but)
You can see a little bit of the desired style

Although it may be published by itself,
it’s designed to be published alongside the OET-RV similar to
