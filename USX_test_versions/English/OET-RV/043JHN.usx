  <para style="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by John, brother of James—both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Jesus that he selected as His apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of them, John was the one that greatly loved Jesus, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Jesus' actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and they had all worked on Lake Galilee as fishermen.</para>
  <para style="is2">This account</para>
  <para style="ip">We place John's account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Jesus the messiah. Not only is Jesus the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Jesus, John does however tell us about John-the-Immerser who came before Jesus to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.</para>
  <para style="ip">In chapters two to twelve it's written how the various miracles that Jesus did showed that he was the promised messiah to offer life without ending to whoever would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Jesus at every turn.</para>
  <para style="ip">In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Jesus towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.</para>
  <para style="ip">In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Jesus, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.</para>
  <para style="ip">John is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Jesus came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Jesus himself is the road, the truth, and the life.</para>
