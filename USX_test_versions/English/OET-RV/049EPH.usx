  <para style="ip">This <char style="bk">Letter to the believers in Ephesus</char> was written by Paul from prison in Rome.</para>
  <para style="is2">This letter</para>
  <para style="ip">This letter wasn't just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul's main theme is about God's plan that “at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah” (1:10).</para>
  <para style="ip">In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Jesus the messiah.</para>
  <para style="ip">In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it's like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.</para>
  <para style="ip">It's also explained here about the correct behaviour of couples, of parents and children, and of slaves and master. Then in concluding his letter, it's explained about the armour that's given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan's attacks.</para>
