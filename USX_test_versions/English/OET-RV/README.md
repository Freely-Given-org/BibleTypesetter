# Open English Translation Readers’ Version (OET-RV)

Sample USX files for SILE typesetting development.

Note that the OET-RV is typeset differently from most traditional Bibles.

1. Section headings don’t break the flow of the text, but are contained in a right-aligned box
2. Section cross-references (where they exist) also go in the same box in a smaller font
3. Chapter numbers are downplayed so a bit smaller than other Bibles make them (definitely no drop caps styles please)
4. Added words (in &lt;char style="add"&gt;...&lt;/char&gt;) are grey (not italics like many Bibles)

(It’s not styled very well yet, but)
You can see a little bit of the desired style

Although it may be published by itself,
it’s designed to be published alongside the OET-LV similar to
