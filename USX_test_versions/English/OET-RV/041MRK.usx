  <para style="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Mary (&lt;a href="ACT.html#C12V12"&gt;Acts 12:12&lt;/a&gt;).</para>
  <para style="ip">Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (&lt;a href="COL.html#C4V10"&gt;Col. 4:10&lt;/a&gt;) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Jesus the messiah (&lt;a href="ACT.html#C12V25"&gt;Acts 12:25&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="ACT.html#C13V13"&gt;13:13&lt;/a&gt;). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (&lt;a href="PE1.html#C5V13"&gt;1 Peter 5:13&lt;/a&gt;), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Jesus had done and taught.</para>
  <para style="is2">This account</para>
  <para style="ip">This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn't use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.</para>
  <para style="ip">Mark explains here that Jesus came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘mankind's child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in &lt;a href="#C10V45"&gt;10:45&lt;/a&gt;: “Even mankind's child didn't come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Jesus did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Jesus by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.</para>
  <para style="ip">The ending of this account is often disputed, and scholars are still &lt;a href="https:<optbreak />textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark"&gt;debating&lt;/a&gt; about whether or not the longer ending (&lt;a href="#C16V9"&gt;16:9-20&lt;/a&gt;) is original. The <char style="em">OET</char> includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.</para>
