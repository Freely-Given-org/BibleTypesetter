After that, I will bring you out peacefully from there. <verse eid="BAR 6:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="BAR 6:4" />But now you will see in Babylon gods of silver, gold, wood carried on shoulders, which cause the nations to fear. <verse eid="BAR 6:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="BAR 6:5" />Beware therefore that you in no way become like these foreigners. Don’t let fear take hold of you because of them when you see the multitude before them and behind them, worshiping them. <verse eid="BAR 6:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="BAR 6:6" />But say in your hearts, “O Lord, we must worship you.” <verse eid="BAR 6:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="BAR 6:7" />For my angel is with you, and I myself care for your souls. <verse eid="BAR 6:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="BAR 6:8" />For their tongue is polished by the workman, and they themselves are overlaid with gold and with silver; yet they are only fake, and can’t speak. <verse eid="BAR 6:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="BAR 6:9" />And taking gold, as if it were for a virgin who loves to be happy, they make crowns for the heads of their gods. <verse eid="BAR 6:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="BAR 6:10" />Sometimes also the priests take gold and silver from their gods, and spend it on themselves. <verse eid="BAR 6:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="BAR 6:11" />The will even give some of it to the common prostitutes. They dress them like men with garments, even the gods of silver, gods of gold, and gods of wood. <verse eid="BAR 6:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="BAR 6:12" />Yet these gods can’t save themselves from rust and moths, even though they are covered with purple garments. <verse eid="BAR 6:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="BAR 6:13" />They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, which is thick upon them. <verse eid="BAR 6:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="BAR 6:14" />And he who can’t put to death one who offends against him holds a sceptre, as though he were judge of a country. <verse eid="BAR 6:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="BAR 6:15" />He has also a dagger in his right hand, and an axe, but can’t deliver himself from war and robbers. <verse eid="BAR 6:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="BAR 6:16" />By this they are known not to be gods. Therefore don’t fear them. <verse eid="BAR 6:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="BAR 6:17" />For like a vessel that a man uses is worth nothing when it is broken, even so it is with their gods. When they are set up in the temples, their eyes are full of dust through the feet of those who come in. <verse eid="BAR 6:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="BAR 6:18" />As the courts are secured on every side upon him who offends the king, as being committed to suffer death, even so the priests secure their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lest they be carried off by robbers. <verse eid="BAR 6:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="BAR 6:19" />They light candles for them, yes, more than for themselves, even though they can’t see one. <verse eid="BAR 6:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="BAR 6:20" />They are like one of the beams of the temple.

Therefore don’t fear them. <verse eid="BAR 6:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="BAR 6:24" />Notwithstanding the gold with which they are covered to make them beautiful, unless someone wipes off the tarnish, they won’t shine; for they didn’t even feel it when they were molten. <verse eid="BAR 6:24" /><verse number="25" style="v" sid="BAR 6:25" />Things in which there is no breath are bought at any cost. <verse eid="BAR 6:25" /><verse number="26" style="v" sid="BAR 6:26" />Having no feet, they are carried upon shoulders. By this, they declare to men that they are worth nothing. <verse eid="BAR 6:26" /><verse number="27" style="v" sid="BAR 6:27" />Those who serve them are also ashamed, for if they fall to the ground at any time, they can’t rise up again by themselves. If they are bowed down, they can’t make themselves straight; but the offerings are set before them, as if they were dead men. <verse eid="BAR 6:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="BAR 6:28" />And the things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and spend. In like manner, their wives also lay up part of it in salt; but to the poor and to the impotent they give none of it. <verse eid="BAR 6:28" /><verse number="29" style="v" sid="BAR 6:29" />The menstruous woman and the woman in childbed touch their sacrifices, knowing therefore by these things that they are no gods. Don’t fear them. <verse eid="BAR 6:29" /><verse number="30" style="v" sid="BAR 6:30" />For how can they be called gods? Because women set food before the gods of silver, gold, and wood. <verse eid="BAR 6:30" /><verse number="31" style="v" sid="BAR 6:31" />And in their temples the priests sit on seats, having their clothes torn and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing on their heads. <verse eid="BAR 6:31" /><verse number="32" style="v" sid="BAR 6:32" />They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead. <verse eid="BAR 6:32" /><verse number="33" style="v" sid="BAR 6:33" />The priests also take off garments from them and clothe their wives and children with them. <verse eid="BAR 6:33" /><verse number="34" style="v" sid="BAR 6:34" />Whether it is evil or good what one does to them, they are not able to repay it. They can’t set up a king or put him down. <verse eid="BAR 6:34" /><verse number="35" style="v" sid="BAR 6:35" />In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money. Though a man make a vow to them and doesn’t keep it, they will never exact it. <verse eid="BAR 6:35" /><verse number="36" style="v" sid="BAR 6:36" />They can save no man from death.
