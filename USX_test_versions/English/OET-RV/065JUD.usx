  <para style="is2">This letter</para>
  <para style="ip">We don't know which group of believers that this letter was sent to. Here in this letter, Judas warns the believers about teachers of false doctrines who teach that it's okay for believers to continue sinning since they'll just be forgiven due to God's mercy. That's the reason Judas wrote this, to warn the believers so that they won't fall for false beliefs, but instead will continue to follow the true teaching that came from God. He also encourages the readers that it's necessary to strive to continue in their faith in God along with turning away from evil actions.</para>
