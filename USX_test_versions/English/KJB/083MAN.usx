    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="MAN 1:1" />O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed; <verse eid="MAN 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="MAN 1:2" />who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof; <verse eid="MAN 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="MAN 1:3" />who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; <verse eid="MAN 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="MAN 1:4" />whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power; <verse eid="MAN 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="MAN 1:5" />for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners is importable: <verse eid="MAN 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="MAN 1:6" />but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; <verse eid="MAN 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="MAN 1:7" />for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. <verse eid="MAN 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="MAN 1:8" />Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: <verse eid="MAN 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="MAN 1:9" />for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities. <verse eid="MAN 1:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="MAN 1:10" />I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have any release: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences. <verse eid="MAN 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="MAN 1:11" />Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. <verse eid="MAN 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="MAN 1:12" />I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities: <verse eid="MAN 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="MAN 1:13" />wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquites. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent; <verse eid="MAN 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="MAN 1:14" />and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy. <verse eid="MAN 1:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="MAN 1:15" />Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens do praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.<verse eid="MAN 1:15" /></para>
